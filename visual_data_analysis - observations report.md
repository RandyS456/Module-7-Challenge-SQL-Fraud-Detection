##Module 7 Challenge-Fraud Analysis- Visual Data Analysis- Observations and Conclusions Report

1) What difference do you observe between the consumption patterns? Does the difference suggest a fraudulent transaction? Explain.

Cardholder#2's transaction history is showing a visual of a high frequency rate, where there were 99 transactions and a total cost of appoximately $950 against this account in 2018. There was an average of 8 transactions per month and a high of 12 in March 2018.
The size of the average transaction totals per month are about $79 per month, with no transaction above $20. 
If we work on the assumption that hackers are responsible for all the transactions at $2 and less, the total count for cardholder#2 would be 11 instances cited as a hacker's transaction.

Cardholder#18's transaction history by contrast is showing a visual of an even higher frequency rate, where there were 133 transactions and a total cost in excess of $12,000 against this account in 2018. One eye catching graphic are the frequent spikes in the transaction amounts. 
These transaction spikes occurred 7 times during the course of the year and would seem highly irregular for restaurant transactions, yet account for approx. $9,800 of the total $12,000 (81.6%) for 2018. These large transaction spikes also pushed the monthly transaction average to over $1,000 per month. 
If we make an assumption that hackers are responsible for these large spikes in transaction amounts which average over $1,400 per transaction, the total count for cardholder#18 would be 7 instances cited as a hacker's transaction for 2018.

If we remove these large transactions from cardholder#18's transaction history the average transaction amount for the year drops to $17.68, contrast this yearly average by carholder#2's yearly average of $9.59 per transaction for 2018. 
The comparison chart between cardholder#2 and cardholder#18 shows almost an overlap in transaction amounts with the exception of cardholder#18's spikes in the tranaction history.



2) Do you notice any anomalies? Describe your observations and conclusions.

Cardholder#25's transaction history for the months of January 2018 to June 2018, are showing at least nine anomalies on the box plot visual. There are 6 transactions that exceed $1,000, with an additional three transactions that exceed $100.
If the outlier criteria was >$100, then for the month of January there was one outlier, for February there was none, for March there was one, for April there was three, for May there was one, and for June there was three.
Without these transaction anomalies the average transaction over that period will only be $8.58 per transaction. Therefore, with these observations we can conclude that the 6 highest transactions were definitely unathorized transactions, it is highly likely that two of the three next highest transactions ($749.00 and $269.00) are also unauthorized. 
Leaving the $100.00 transaction which can also be assumed to be unauthorized since it is so far from the average.
